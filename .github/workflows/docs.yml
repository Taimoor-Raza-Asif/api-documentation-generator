    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository code
      # This downloads your code (app.js, package.json, etc.) into the runner
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Node.js environment
      # This installs Node.js so we can run npm commands
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Specify your Node.js version
          cache: 'npm'       # Cache npm dependencies for faster builds

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      # This runs 'npm install' to get express, swagger-jsdoc, etc.
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: "Regenerates relevant sections"
      # This runs your 'docs:generate' script from package.json
      # It will create the 'public/openapi.json' file
      - name: Generate API Docs
        run: npm run docs:generate

      # Step 5: "Deploy documentation"
      # This action takes the contents of the 'public' folder (index.html and openapi.json)
      # and deploys it as a static website using GitHub Pages.
